# Hazards Study

This study was made for a school project. The goal is to solve the hazards in the same given code for different processors.

## pb1.s

This program is designed for a 5-stage processor without hazard detection or data forwarding. The solution only uses 'nop' to solve the hazards.

## pb2.s

This program is designed for a 5-stage processor with data forwarding, but without hazard detection. The solution only uses 'nop' to solve the hazards.
